# Simple Monte Carlo Simulation App

This Streamlit app allows users to create and simulate processes using different statistical distributions. Users can add multiple process steps of type **Normal**, **Exponential**, or **Uniform**, configure parameters for each, and visualize the results via a histogram.

## Features:
- **Add Process Steps**: Choose from **Normal**, **Exponential**, or **Uniform** distributions and define their parameters.
- **Run Simulations**: Perform simulations based on added process steps and view the results.
- **Histogram Visualization**: Customize the number of bins for the simulation's histogram.
- **Download Results**: Download the simulation results as a CSV file.
